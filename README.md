# Chokobot

Chokobot is a modular system of three 4-wheeled omnidirectional robots designed for warehouse applications. These robots can connect to form a larger platform, allowing them to transport bulkier items or heavier loads while maintaining agile movement.

## Features

* **Omnidirectional Movement:** Each robot is equipped with four omnidirectional wheels, ensuring precise and agile navigation.
* **Modular Assembly:** The robots can connect to form a single, larger platform for transporting bulkier items or heavier loads.
* **Optitrack System Integration:** Chokobot uses an Optitrack motion capture system with Motive software for accurate odometry and positioning.

## Hardware Components

* 3 omnidirectional robots (4-wheeled each)
* Optitrack motion capture system
* Optitrack Motive software

## Software Stack

* Python
* Motive software for Optitrack
